    "attributes": {
      "orientation": "Determines where the tooltip appears in relation to the triggering element. Valid options are 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right'. If not provided, or if invalid, defaults to auto placement of tooltip.",
      "trigger-style": "Indicates how the tooltip is triggered. Valid presets are 'hover' and 'custom' (defaults to 'hover'). When set to 'hover', the tooltip is triggered when the user moves their cursor over a triggering element, and dismissed when moved off. When set to 'custom', no default behavior is implemented for triggering the tooltip. This is useful when you want to define your own triggering system using the .show(), .hide(), and .toggle() API calls without any default behaviors getting in the way. If set to anything else, the tooltip will use this as the event name to listen for on targeted elems to show the tooltip.",
      "trigger-selector": "Indicates how to select elements that would trigger the tooltip. If given a selector of '_previousSibling', the tooltip will use the immediately preceding sibling element in the DOM tree as its triggering element. Similarly, when set to '_nextSibling', the tooltip will use its next DOM sibling as its triggering element. Otherwise, the selector will be applied to the tooltip's parent node as a search query, and any elements that are not part of the tooltip itself will act as triggering elements for the tooltip. (For example, if you were to provide '.fancy-selector' as this attribute's value, and foo is your tooltip element, the elements you would get back would be same as those found from foo.parentNode.querySelectorAll('.fancy-selector').)",
